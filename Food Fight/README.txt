"Food Fight" is a mobile game being developed as a class project in collaboration with the Cleveland Institute of Art.

The concept of the game is the story of a young student who quickly gets into a a food fight with various other students. 

The design information of the project is included in this folder, along with some concept and charcter art.

The game has reached an beta stage of development. We have finished and presented it for our class, but we are continuing to 
update it and polish it for eventual release.

A current build of the game may be obtained by request.
