This game is a personal project of mine using a cracked version of Nintendo's pokemon game engine. 

The story revolves around you, a protagonist form a distant land who arrives in Kanto, the primary reason from Pokemon Red/Blue.
You arrive prior to the events of Red/Blue, during what is commonly referred to as the "Great Pokemon War," a fan theory
that tries to explain the state of the world in the first few games. You are drafted into the army, and over the course of the game,
meet many important NPC's, such as Red's father, and Blue's parents. The game will be split into two main parts:
1. the repelling of enemy forces from the homeland (Kanto) and
2. the invasion of the enemy's homeland (Johto)

By the end of the game, the world will be in its state from Red/Blue, and you will know how many important events came to be,
such as the Burning of Tin Tower, why the Legendary birds exist in the places they do, and how Team Rocket came to power.



This game is currently in its planning stages. More concrete documents will follow when the game is started proper, and
when the game is complete, a build will be uploaded here.
